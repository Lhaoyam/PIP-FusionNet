# PIP-FusionNet
Proinflammatory peptides are bioactive sequences capable of inducing inflammatory responses and triggering a series of immune reactions in the human body. Due to the high cost of experimentally validating proinflammatory peptide activity, developing computational models that can accurately identify proinflammatory peptide sequences has become a critical need. In this study, we propose a computational framework named MetaDiffPIP for predicting the activity of proinflammatory peptides. The framework: (1) integrates representations from protein large language models with traditional handcrafted features to achieve cross-modal feature fusion; (2) enhances feature extraction by introducing a dual-channel input design in the second-level model within a stacked ensemble architecture; and (3) incorporates the confidence scores generated by the first-level models to achieve more stable predictive performance. Experimental results on the ProInTest dataset demonstrate that, compared with current state-of-the-art methods, MetaDiffPIP achieves improvements of 14% in MCC, 14% in AUC, and 7.1% in ACC.
